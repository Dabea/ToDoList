Architecture
The fron end will asscess the database though an API, The API will use JSON Objects,
    *0* will be set up with dummy datta from a file after that it will connect though an built API,
    *?* currenlty unsure what the backend API will be built with but it will likey use MySQL (between php or node.js)

This is intended to be built with oop practices and will try to be as modular,
This will be stored on my server and GitHub

Project Dependices
  jQuery 2.*
  Requirejs
  bootstrap 3.*
  fontawesome    --* May make customer font sheet at (http://fontello.com/)
  flatpicker (http://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/)  -this may change to other lib or may make my own but very likey choice.

Current Document
    *x* is refrance to versions 0 is pretty much dev/Production where 1 will be base functions working as a To-do List and task
    currenty is unclear how far this project will go.





Additonal Ideas and things to work on
    Animation for the calandar either a slide or a flip animation
    hamberget menu to show the options for when the screen is at a smaller size
    Full screen option for the calandar
    Add a Highlght for currenlty selected view
    Add Animation to the delete Backdrop as it apears


Current Bugs
    Fixed - Deleted misplaced code
    *when an event is moved on the calandar then deleted there is another task that  can apear on the list
        **fix refresh the task list when its navagated to agin --This might be good to be done for all Tabs



    The calandar boxs can be moved
        -- Issue I think is caused by the prevent default on the drop location allowing anything to be droped inside?
            ?? Possiable fix add a if statment if the grabed target has the class dragable?



    Issue with Mobile events not working
            ??Might be due to the type of the element
            ?? Could try adding Jquery Touch event listner?


Graphical Issues // Improvoments
     Issue the events look a litte messed up when the screen goes to its smallest However dose not seem to affect mobile

     The delete icon needs some more borders looks a little funny since it goes off the edge

     Main body hieght not going all the way to the bottom

     The Calandar Should proably be changed to event delegation
