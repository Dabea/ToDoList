CodeStructure
    Clean up code between New Task and  calandar View to make it more dry
        new view for creating New tasks will likey need to be made
    Renameing of function in the TaskView will need to be done
        Mostly around creating new tasks and add new tasks since the names are not nessarly clear

Syle
    When makeing the app "Full Size" Make it apear its coverd vs fadeing off the screen

    Improve the calandar View Task Display ( Long Descriptions will be off center and not in the highlight orange In smaller windows sizes




Functional / UIX
    Able to Edit the Tasks

    Module that will open more infomation from the Calandar View when doulbe clicked

    In task view improve the closeing interface currtly a litte pick on where it needs to be click inorder to reclose the description

    Check all button to complete tasks

    The Delete Yes No Boxs can go off screen on smaller views (It adds a Scrool Bar However is not a good UX)
